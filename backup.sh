# Script usage
# backup.sh folderlist.txt
#
# usage:
# rsync -avh --progress --delete /source /destination
#
# Options
#
# -a: -a indicates archive mode. Is equivalent to rsync -rlptgoD. Include Recursive mode, Preserves symbolic links, Preserves permissions, Preserves timestamp, Preserves owner and group.
# -v: -v verbose
# -z: -z is to enable compression
# -r: -r indicates recursive
# -h: This option produces numbers in the log file and stdout in a more human-readable format.
# --delete: This tells rsync to delete any files that are in destination that arenâ€™t in source. If you choose to use this option, I recommend also using the verbose options, for reasons mentioned above.
# --progress: This option tells rsync to print information showing the progress of the transfer.
# --exclude: --exclude option will cause files that match the given patterns to be excluded
# --stats: --stats shows a detailed stats of each backup. You can monitor the amount of traffic being sent over your network and such.
